### About

This is  an attempt to create a native application for weather reports of all cities around the globe using React Native. This repo currently holds an android version of the app. Technology stack used:
1. **React Native (https://reactnative.dev/)**

### Data Source and Third party libraries

There are two APIs thorugh which data is being sourced:
1. **OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/)**
2. **Mapbox Geocoding API (https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/#geocoding)**

Third party libraries used:
1. **React Native Chart kit (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-chart-kit)**

**Please note:** This application requires contributions for optimization and clean up. Code compilation for Apple devices is yet to be achieved. Expo-cli and expo development should be avoided, if possible. Use **BEM** convention for stylesheet classnames **(http://getbem.com/)**.

### To get started:

1. `npx react-native start`: Starts the development server
2. `npx react-native run-android`: Installs and runs the app in an android device

**For further resources on how to create builds for apple and android devices refer the React Native official documentation for Environment setup here (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)**
